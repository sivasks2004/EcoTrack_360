## 🚀 Overview

Inefficient waste segregation and overflowing bins are major urban challenges. EcoTrack360 provides a **real-time monitoring solution** with dual-partition smart bins that separate **organic and inorganic waste at the source**.  

- Sensors detect waste type and bin levels.  
- Data is sent to a **cloud platform** for monitoring.  
- A **mobile app** enables users to locate bins, scan waste, and get alerts.  
- AI-based waste classifier ensures accurate segregation.  
- Optimized routes reduce fuel costs and improve efficiency.
